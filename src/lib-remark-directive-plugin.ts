/**
 * The document grammar shared with the Dispatch server has exactly one directive form: the
 * `:::name{...}` container that carries a typed block. remark-directive's full grammar also
 * accepts leaf (`::name`) and text (`:name`) directives, and its text form takes `:` followed by
 * any non-punctuation character, so ordinary prose such as `16:25Z`, `a:b` or `:176-177` parses
 * as a directive; the server stores that text verbatim, so a document it accepted must read back
 * here as the same literal text. Registering only the container construct makes those characters
 * plain text at the tokenizer, the way the server reads them, rather than directive nodes a later
 * pass has to undo (a leaf directive interrupts a paragraph, so undoing it after the fact would
 * still leave one paragraph split in three).
